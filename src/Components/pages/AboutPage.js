        Effective product pages immediately convey the value of a featured
        product. They show potential customers what a product looks like, tell
        them what it feels like, and make them believe it’s something they
        absolutely need to own. There are so many different features and
        variations marketers can choose when building a product page. I’m going
        to show you some of my favorites and walk through what makes them so
        great, in the hope that you can apply some of their features to your
        next product page design. Hope you enjoy! And don’t blame me if you find
        yourself wanting to purchase one or more of these products. That is,
        after all, the very purpose of an effective product page.
